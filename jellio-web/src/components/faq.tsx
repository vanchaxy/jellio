const QUESTIONS = [
  {
    id: 'what-is-plexio',
    question: `What is Plexio?`,
    answer: `Plexio is an addon that connects Plex with Stremio, enabling you to stream your Plex content directly
             within the Stremio interface. It allows you to integrate Plex's media library, manage metadata, and enjoy
             seamless streaming across devices.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'is-plexio-secure',
    question: `Is Plexio secure?`,
    answer: `Yes, Plexio is secure. The code is available on GitHub, allowing you to review and verify its security.
             It uses OAuth for safe login without requiring you to share your Plex password. Additionally, if needed,
             you can terminate access through the "Authorized Devices" tab in your Plex account settings.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'how-plexio-work',
    question: `How does Plexio work?`,
    answer: `Plexio uses the Plex API to match Stremio IMDB data to the corresponding Plex media ID and provide metadata
             for your content. The addon itself is not involved in streaming; it only supplies metadata. Streaming works
             directly between the Stremio client and your Plex Media Server.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'where-find-support',
    question: `Where can I find support?`,
    answer: `You can find support on our Discord channel, through GitHub issues, or by email. Links to all support
             channels are located in the top-left corner of the page.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'can-self-host',
    question: `Can I self-host?`,
    answer: `Yes, you can self-host Plexio. Instructions are available in the source code repository's README file.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'what-is-transcoded',
    question: `What is a transcoded stream?`,
    answer: `A transcoded stream is a version of your media that’s converted to a different format or resolution to suit
             your device or network. Direct play is usually better, as it streams the original file without
             modification. Use transcoding if the original file isn’t compatible with your device or if your network
             needs a lower bitrate for smoother playback.`,
